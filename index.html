      <p>My name is Zarina Mazieva, I am originally from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. It is small country located in Central Asia and is a former Republic of Soviet Union. I was born there, finished school and university and moved to the United States back in 2004. I hold Master of Science degree in Economics from Bishkek Humanities University. My diploma thesis was about “Advantages and disadvantages of Free Economic Zones and their impact on National Economy”. Besides English I can also speak Russian.</p>

      <p>After moving to the United States, I mostly worked in banking industry and trading stocks as a hobby. My first position was with US Bank as an banker. My last position was with Bank of America as a Relationship Manager. During my career I learned how to help customers by understanding their financial situation and offering them the right solution and product.</p>

      <p>Now I would like to take a new path in my career and continue my education to learn new skills in Web Development. I’m very excited to attend this program and make first steps toward achieving the career goal I’ve been dreaming about.</p>
